# What is an Instruction of Use

Instructions for Use or IFUs is information provided by the manufacturer to inform the user of a deviceâ€™s intended purpose, proper use, and any precautions. IFUs are used mainly in the medical field, specifically for prescription drugs and medical devices.  

IFUs are included in all devices including ones that have the smallest modifications which are intended to improve the quality of the product even if the original is still on the market.  

IFUs need to include a detailed description of the device including identifying the differences between related products even if it was manufactured by your own company.  

According to [Code of Federal Regulations Title 21](google.com), all medical equipment, devices and accessories sold for clinical use needs to include an IFU. However, the only exception are Class | and Class IIA if it can be used safely without any instructions. An example of [Class I products](google.com) include bandages, handheld surgical instruments, and nonelectric wheelchairs. [Class IIA products](google.com) include:

* Blood Pressure Cuffs
* Syringes
* Blood Transfusion Devices
* Powered Wheelchairs
* Contact Lenses
* Software used as Diagnostic Tools

Companies that do not provide IFUs with the product must be able to answer any questions from customers includeing if the device is safe to use without the documentation.

__Note:__ if hard copies of the IFU are not available, the manufacturer must provide it in electronic form
